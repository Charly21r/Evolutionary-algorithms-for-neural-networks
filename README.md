# Evolutionary Algorithm for Neural Networks

Exploring the applications of evolutionary algorithms on neural networks.

In this repository you can find:
- An implementation of a genetic algorithm to train a neural network (with pytorch)
- An implementation of the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm

### Training Neural Networks with genetic algorithm
- Build custom Neural Network with Pytorch
- Implement genetic algorithm
- Training the neural network on the "make_moons" dataset, using the genetic algorithm
